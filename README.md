# git-workshop

*Created by Chris Grandin, February 2014*

git-workshop is a repository for learning how to use git version control.
Also included are examples for using *Latex* and the R package *knitr* to apply version control to documents
which are to be edited by more than one person, working collaboratively.


The purpose is to introduce git version control to new users and supply some
useful tools for working with git.

To make everything in this repository work correctly, you will need to [sign up for Github](https://github.com/ "Create account on Github"),
and install the following things on your computer.

[Which .NET version is on my machine?](https://github.com/downloads/shanselman/SmallestDotNet/CheckForDotNet45.exe "Which .NET version is on my machine?")

2. [Github for Windows](http://windows.github.com "Github for Windows")
3. [Miktex typesetting software](http://mirrors.ctan.org/systems/win32/miktex/setup/basic-miktex-2.9.5105-x64.exe "Miktex")

Once you have installed github for Windows, go to my [git-workshop](https://github.com/cgrandin/git-workshop "https://github.com/cgrandin/git-workshop")
and **Fork** the project (button on the top right).

Open the Git Shell. The shortcut should be
**C:\Users\your-computer-user-name\AppData\Local\GitHub\GitHub.appref-ms --open-shell**

It should start you in the directory **c:\github**

Type the following to clone your repository onto your local machine:

      git clone https://github.com/your-git-user-name/git-workshop
